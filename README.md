# collapse

Chrome extension for [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com). 

Auto-collapses comments and colors threads that have 5 points and more in red. 

## Install

1. Clone or download repository
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/` and select `Developer mode` (top right)
1. Click `Load unpacked` and select the extensionâ€™s directory

## Caveats

1. Only works on HN submission pages
1. Does not access user data
1. Did not test with logged-in user (I have another auto-collapse script but it's more complicated)
